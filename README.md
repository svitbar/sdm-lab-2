# Circular singly linked list

## Description

This is an application for creating a circular singly linked list. The first implementation created lists based on built-in arrays/lists, but it was later rewritten to create circular singly linked lists. The application includes various methods for working with lists.

## Variant

My student ID: 1202
My variant: <code>1202 % 4 = 2</code><br>

Task:
To implement class that creates **list based on built-in arrays/lists**. Then rewrite it to create **create circular singly linked lists**. Cover class with unit tests.

## How to run the programm

Make sure you have installed Node.js.

Clone the repository. Run<br>
<code>npm install</code><br>

To see the examples of using run<br>
<code>npm start</code><br>

To test the app run<br>
<code>npm test</code>

## Conclusion

Unit testing is a great way to determine if your code works as intended. It helped me a lot to check if all functions work as they should. Unit tests were especially useful when I rewrote the code for the second implementation
